Attempt to build a better bunkabiker web-app

## Justification (from fb post)

A plea for professional help for the group: 

We are in quite desperate need of a custom designed program for the network to continue growing. ZeeMaps is terrible for how I’m using it but no other system exists that’s better. I’m quite poor so I’m looking for people who are willing to help because they want to help a good cause. 

What I’m looking for in a program: 

- A GUI map system that allows for user profiles with logins. Can be seen in multiple languages. (I’m still not okay with allowing the rating of hosts but I’m down for the rating of guests.) 
- When a host joins, it auto verifies number and email are good. Then sends a text to verify that you want to join. Text to accept and also to change information on the pin on the fly. (Ex: update pin color: purple, update phone number: 1-999-999-9999, etc.) 
- built-in information for contact, the website, how to donate, merch, etc. 
- Hopefully that works as an Apple/Play store app as well. (I’m envisioning something simple like iOverlander’s app.) 
- Has an agreement page before seeing the map. 
- Has check boxes for things offered (bed, couch, meals, yard, trees, shower, tools) and boxes for house situation (alcohol ok, 420, pets in house, kids, leaves early for work) 

It sounds like a lot but everyone I’ve spoken to says it doesn’t sound hard for the person with the right skills. If you’re able to help with this idea or know someone who can, I’m all ears about what to do! I’ve got a CSV with all the current hosts’ info if it helps. Thank you!
